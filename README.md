### Project: Airbnb Sales Analysis

#### Overview

This repository contains a Power BI project for analyzing Airbnb sales data. The project aims to provide insights into sales performance, trends, and key metrics related to Airbnb listings. The primary file is a Power BI report that has been saved in the Power BI Project format (.pbip) for version control purposes.

#### Files in this Repository

  * **`Airbnb Sales Analysis.pbix`**: The main Power BI Desktop file that contains the report and data model.
  * **`Dataset Files/Airbnb_Open_Data.csv`**: The raw dataset used for the analysis.
  * **`.gitignore`**: A file that tells Git which files and folders to ignore, ensuring unnecessary local files and caches are not committed to the repository.

*Note: This project was saved using the Power BI Project (.pbip) format, which separates the report and semantic model into text-based files for easier version control with Git. This allows for better tracking of changes and collaboration.*
